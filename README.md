# Orlando Residential Condo Development ‚Äì Real Estate Financial Modeling Case Study

## üìå Project Overview

This project is a **real estate financial modeling case study** of a proposed **residential condominium development** in the **Orlando Metro Area (Florida, USA)**. The goal of this study is to evaluate the financial feasibility of a ground-up condo project using standard project finance methods, incorporating **development costs, financing assumptions, absorption schedules, and profit metrics**.

The study demonstrates my ability to build **dynamic Excel financial model** for real estate development, analyze **project risks and returns**, and benchmark assumptions against real-world Orlando market data.

# The Cash Flow Tab

The Cash Flow Tab is the engine of your model ‚Äî it consolidates assumptions (schedule, sales, costs, financing) into monthly or quarterly cash flows and calculates key metrics like IRR, NPV, Equity Multiple, etc.

### Timeline of the Project

* The project runs over several years, starting with **land acquisition**, followed by **construction**, and ending with **unit sales and closings**.
* All inflows (sales revenue) and outflows (costs, financing) are laid out **month by month**.

### Where the Money Goes (Outflows)

* **Land purchase** is paid upfront.
* **Construction costs** (hard + soft) are spread across the construction period.
* **Consulting, marketing, and overhead** are paid steadily throughout.
* **Contingencies** (hard and soft) are added on top as buffers.
* **Financing costs** (loan interest, bank fees) accrue while debt is outstanding.

### How the Project is Funded (Sources)

* **Equity contributions** from investors cover early costs like land and pre-development.
* **Construction loan** kicks in to fund monthly draws once equity is used.
* Interest on the loan is capitalized (added to the balance) until sales start repaying it.

### When the Money Comes Back (Inflows)

* **Condo sales** generate revenue when units are closed (not just when pre-sold).
* Closings start at construction completion and continue monthly until all units are sold.
* From these inflows, the loan is paid down first, then remaining funds flow back to investors.

## üìä Key Insights

* **Feasibility:** With a 20% IRR and 46% ROE, this project is financially attractive, assuming strong absorption and sales pricing.
* **Risk Factors:** Construction cost volatility, sales absorption pace, and pricing sensitivity (a 5‚Äì10% shift can significantly impact IRR).
* **Market Alignment:** Benchmarked against real Orlando condo comps in Downtown, Lake Nona, and Winter Park.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Methods

* **Excel for financial modeling**
* **DCF (Discounted Cash Flow) modeling** for IRR and NPV calculations
* **Waterfall structures** for LP/GP IRR analysis

## üìé References

* Recent Orlando apartment complex (Downtown, Lake Nona, Winter Park)
